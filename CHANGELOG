CHANGELOG:

* Fix defect with absent JavaScript environment which present tests from 
  running.
* Move Ruby version specification from Gemfile to standard .ruby-version file
  which is understood by several ruby version managers like RVM and rv-env and
  produce no warnings in standard configuration on RVM. Plus, it's used by RVM 
  by default.
* Specify gemset name in .ruby-gemset file. This is simplify to separate scope 
  of gems from other projects on developer's computers and on some production
  deployments as well.
* Used Ruby version MRI 1.9.3 is stale and it's officially recommended to
  switch to one of 2.x branches because of security and support. Also some
  feature and performance improvements (most singificant is GC) was made in
  latest versions of MRI interpreter was made.
  So, Ruby update simplify and improve development and production usage process.
