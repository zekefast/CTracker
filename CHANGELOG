CHANGELOG:

* Fix defect with absent JavaScript environment which present tests from
  running.
* Move Ruby version specification from Gemfile to standard .ruby-version file
  which is understood by several ruby version managers like RVM and rv-env and
  produce no warnings in standard configuration on RVM. Plus, it's used by RVM
  by default.
* Specify gemset name in .ruby-gemset file. This is simplify to separate scope
  of gems from other projects on developer's computers and on some production
  deployments as well.
* Used Ruby version MRI 1.9.3 is stale and it's officially recommended to
  switch to one of 2.x branches because of security and support. Also some
  feature and performance improvements (most singificant is GC) was made in
  latest versions of MRI interpreter was made.
  So, Ruby update simplify and improve development and production usage process.
* Many bug fixes and features was made to new version of Ruby on Rails 4.1.1.
  So, to avoid fixing stale and commonly know problems and not to implement features
  present in 4.1.1 branch application moved to latest version of Ruby on Rails
  (4.1.1).
 * Update files generated on creation of default Ruby on Rails application.
 * Use "strong parameters" instead of "attr_accessible".
 * Update "cucumber-rails" to fix warning in cucumber test runs.
 * Replace unsupported :consitions keys for ActiveRecord scopes to lambdas.
 * Fix test helper should_not_respond_to_actions method by changin expected
   exception from ActionController::RoutingError to
   ActionController::UrlGenerationError.
 * Disable turbolinks.
 * Fix DataUpdater, because of changed ActiveRecord API.
   find_and_create_by_code(attributes) call was replaced with
   create_with(attributes).find_and_create_by(code: attributes[:code]).
* TestUnit for Ruby is rarely used nowadays.
  There is a commonly known better replacement to it, like RSpec.
  Latest version of it 3.0.0 and along with new powerful feature it doesn't
  polute tested objects with test specific methods (when expect syntax is used).
  So, it's worth to upgrade tests framework to RSpec.
 * Migrate TestUnit tests to RSpec:
  * Migrate models tests.
  * Migrate controllers tests.
 * Replace customer test helper test_validates_presence_of with similar one 
   provided by "shoulda-matchers" gem.
 * Replace customer test helper should_not_respond_to_actions with
   shared examples with similar name.
 * Move fixtures from test/ directory to spec/.
 * Remove warnings in features/step_definitions/web_steps.rb caused by usage of
   should syntax.
