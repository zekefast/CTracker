CHANGELOG:

* Fix defect with absent JavaScript environment which present tests from 
  running.
* Move Ruby version specification from Gemfile to standard .ruby-version file
  which is understood by several ruby version managers like RVM and rv-env and
  produce no warnings in standard configuration on RVM. Plus, it's used by RVM 
  by default.
* Specify gemset name in .ruby-gemset file. This is simplify to separate scope 
  of gems from other projects on developer's computers and on some production
  deployments as well.
