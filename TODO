TODO:

* TestUnit for Ruby is rarely used nowadays.
  There is a commonly known better replacement to it, like RSpec.
  Latest version of it 3.0.0 and along with new powerful feature it doesn't
  polute tested objects with test specific methods (when expect syntax is used).
  So, it's worth to upgrade tests framework to RSpec.
* There is a much better replacement to static fixtures provided by Rails.
  Replace Rails's fixtures with "rails-factory_girl".
