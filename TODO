TODO:

* Specify gemset name in .ruby-gemset file. This is simplify to separate scope 
  of gems from other projects on developer's computers and on some production
  deployments as well.
* Used Ruby version MRI 1.9.3 is stale and it's officially recommended to 
  switch to one of 2.x branches because of security and support. Also some 
  feature and performance improvements (most singificant is GC) was made in 
  latest versions of MRI interpreter was made.
  So, Ruby update simplify and improve development and production usage process.
* Many bug fixes and features was made to new version of Ruby on Rails 4.x.
  So, to avoid fixing stale and commonly know problems and reimplement features
  present in 4.x branch application moved to latest version of Ruby on Rails 
  4.x branch.
* TestUnit for Ruby is rarely used nowadays. 
  There is a commonly known better replacement to it, like RSpec. 
  Latest version of it 3.0.0 and along with new powerful feature it doesn't
  polute tested objects with test specific methods (when expect syntax is used).
  So, it's worth to upgrade tests framework to RSpec.
* There is a much better replacement to static fixtures provided by Rails.
  Replace Rails's fixtures with "rails-factory_girl".
